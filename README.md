This is the new Mikandi Inapp library. It brings Mikandi related functionality to developers who develop for the MiKandi app store. This library allows developers to log in users to Mikandi within their app, to make in-app purchases using MiKandi Gold. We have also provided functionality to check for previous in-app purchases. 
 
This library is to be improved steadily in the foresee-able future as we upgrade our back end systems and have the option to add more features. 

There are extensive documentation for the library that can be found here: http://tools.mikandi.com/confluence/display/KANDI/KandiLibs+Documentation

and an example app created to allow developers to see the functionality of the library in action here: https://github.com/mikandi/kandibilling-android-example
