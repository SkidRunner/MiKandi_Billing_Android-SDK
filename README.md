MiKandi in-app library v1.0.0

This is the new Mikandi Inapp library. It brings Mikandi related functionality to developers who develop for the MiKandi app store. This library allows developers to log in users to Mikandi within their app, to make in-app purchases using MiKandi Gold. We have also provided functionality to check for previous in-app purchases. 
 
This library is to be improved steadily in the foresee-able future as we upgrade our back end systems and have the option to add more features. 

There are extensive documentation for the library that can be found here:http://tools.mikandi.com/confluence/display/KANDI/KandiLibs+Documentation

and an example app created to allow developers to see the functionality of the library in action here: https://bitbucket.org/mikandi/inapp-example-app

**Please note that if you are too use the example application you will need to enter your own secret key and appid of your application into the Android manifest**
